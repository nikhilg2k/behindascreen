# Blog Project

First Web Development Project

The frontend work is mostly complete

The post data is currently stored statically but with backend implementation it will be done dynamically

Currently the tags, subscribe and archive features are not implemented

The whatsapp share button is functional and share will work when the website comes online (I intend to host it using heroku)
