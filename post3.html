                Yoga Guru turned businessman; Baba Ramdev has had his fair share of controversies in the past. 
                He is back in the news following his sly comments on modern allopathic medicine. 
                He can be heard on video, reading a WhatsApp forward that claims that 
                <span class="quote">“Allopathy ek stupid science hai” </span>
                and goes on to add that allopathic medicines have caused lakhs of deaths in the covid pandemic 
                and more people have died from modern medicines than from the shortage of oxygen. 
                Moreover, he has now been filmed claiming that nobody’s father can arrest him, after the slew 
                of lawsuits and defamation notices against him. 
            </p>
            <p>
                While in today's internet culture this will be meme material for a few days before everyone 
                moves on to a new fad, it is important to realize that baba is not just some ordinary person 
                who went viral for some funny statements. Baba Ramdev, through his incredible work in teaching 
                and preaching yoga in a country obsessed with naturopathy and driven by spirited nationalism, 
                has established a cult-like following of loyalists who have invested their trust and faith in him. 
                Such statements from a celebrity of his stature are not only irresponsible but are also potentially
                 dangerous for the national good.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="subheading">A reality check on the achievements of modern medicine:</span>
                First, we need to do a reality check for the respected guru and establish the marvels of modern 
                medicine and its unparalleled achievements just in the past year in the context of the pandemic. 
                Within a year modern medicine has been able to detect and decode the genetic sequence of an 
                entirely new pathogen, develop a fairly good understanding of how it affects the human body and 
                scientists all over the world have worked tirelessly together to develop not just one, but many 
                vaccines at an unprecedented pace. These vaccines are the only hope that humanity has of ending 
                this dreadful pandemic. Moreover, doctors, nurses and other medical personnel, have slogged day 
                and night to take care of the endless number of patients, putting themselves and their families 
                at risk, fighting a completely new disease without any past research. They have developed 
                effective treatment protocols for patients with varying degrees of severity of illness and have 
                in the process sacrificed their lives to save millions around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Baba’s comments come at a time when the biggest challenge to humanity’s battle against 
                this wretched virus is vaccine hesitancy. 
                The only way we can win this war against this unrelenting invisible enemy is if everyone comes 
                forward to take the jab and stop the chain of transmission. In a situation like this it is the 
                moral and ethical obligation of anyone on a pedestal who enjoys a loyal fanbase and a trusting 
                audience to use their voice and their platform for public good and encourage people to take their 
                shots. This is their duty towards the nation and the people. 
                <span class="italic-text bold-text new-line">This, in the true sense of the word, is nationalism. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                Every person who gets influenced by his words and becomes averse to vaccination lends a massive 
                blow to India's covid fight and Baba Ramdev must be held accountable for the consequences of 
                his unconscientious and distasteful statements. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="subheading">Yoga guru vs business tycoon:</span>
                In retrospect, it is not so difficult to understand why Baba would say something of this sort. 
                He may have been a yoga guru but now he is an unscrupulous business tycoon and he has used fear 
                mongering in the past amongst his followers to promote his brand of Ayurveda. Moreover, being in 
                the good books of the government has been an enabling factor for him and he has been making 
                increasingly preposterous claims with little to no reprimand. A distrust in modern medicine can 
                be a great reason for his followers to opt for his “Coronil” immunity boosting medicine. 
                Never mind that “immunity boosting” does not have any credible scientific basis and nothing can 
                give you immunity from the virus other than the vaccines. His medicines may pass safety tests but 
                they have not passed any tests of effectiveness. There are no peer reviewed studies nor any data, 
                only the word of the respected yoga guru. Quite unfortunately for many of his followers his word 
                carries more weight than the mountains of evidence that modern medicine has to offer for itself. 
                <span class="new-line">This is not to say that Ayurveda is not effective or that yoga is not 
                beneficial. The entire world has realized the importance of yoga and meditation for general 
                physical and mental well-being. Baba Ramdev has a massive contribution in spreading this gift 
                to millions in India. Ayurveda has also been proved to be an effective form of supportive 
                treatment in various conditions. What is important to understand is that yoga and Ayurveda are 
                a means to a healthier lifestyle, not a replacement of modern medicine. The two disciplines are 
                complimentary, not opposing. </span>

                Music - The series has an inspiring score that blends in with the screenplay and complements the 
                visuals very well without being overpowering or jarring. The theme is sure to stay in your heart 
                for a long time even after finishing the series.
            </p>
            <p>
                Although it is a pipe dream, I do hope that wisdom prevails and Guruji realizes his 
                responsibility towards the country and motivates his followers to continue to follow covid 
                appropriate behavior and get the vaccines as soon as they can. This will be a greater service 
                to the nation than any non-approved herbal health product that his company has to offer.
