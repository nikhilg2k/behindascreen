            <p>
                The 21st century has ushered in an era of internet ubiquity where computer networks are 
                involved in all aspects of modern life. The coronavirus pandemic has accelerated our dependence 
                on the internet. This ever-increasing reliance of society on the internet and the exponential 
                growth of cyberspace has inevitably led to a generational change in warfare. 
                The digital revolution has kickstarted widespread discussions about the need for 
                cybersecurity and many countries now consider cyberattacks to be the most imminent 
                threat to national security. While this has certainly garnered attention towards cyber 
                defence but what is often overlooked is the need to enhance the nation’s capability of 
                cyber offence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Computer networks are an integral part of every industry. 
                From communication, media and education to banking, logistics and governance, 
                the internet is indispensable. The threat of cyberattacks has suddenly been brought 
                into public consciousness due to the recent reports of Chinese hackers targeting India’s 
                Serum Institute and Bharat Biotech, the two vaccine manufacturers in the country involved 
                in the COVID vaccination campaign. Chinese hacking group APT10 or ‘Stone Panda’ is said to 
                have carried out this attack possibly to steal intellectual property related to the vaccines. 
                Moreover, reports suggest that the 2-hour power outage in Mumbai on October 13, 2020 was caused 
                by Chinese malware that had infiltrated into Indian power supply infrastructure. 
                <span class="new-line"> This came at the peak of the COVID crisis in the city and hospitals had to use emergency 
                generators to keep the life support systems running. This cyberattack is believed to have been 
                a “warning” to Indian authorities amid the ongoing border clashes in Ladakh. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                This illustrates how critical the threat of cyber security is to India. 
                In the event of a war a cyber-attack affecting multiple aspects of civilian life could 
                lead to an unprecedented internal crisis diverting attention from the borders. 
                A failure of communication systems or media could lead to brief or even prolonged 
                periods of “blindness” giving advantages to the enemy in the physical battlefield. 
                Even without a war a widespread cyber-attack can lend a severe blow to the economy as 
                markets go down, power grids fail, transportation comes to a standstill and basic necessities 
                cannot reach people. 
            </p>
            <p>
                India needs to have the capability to tackle this threat and one way to do that is to have a 
                force that can act as a deterrent. India needs to realize the importance of having enhanced 
                capabilities of cyber offence. Just as it is important to have offensive capabilities in a war 
                fought across the border, it is important to have offensive capabilities in a war fought in 
                cyberspace. A report by the Foreign Policy magazine suggests that the Chinese PLA may have 
                anywhere between 50,000 to 100,000 personnel in a “hacker army” [1]. 
                <span class="new-line">Other state sponsored 
                actors are extremely difficult to trace due to the nature of cyberspace giving the state 
                plausible deniability. With increasing incidents of Chinese state linked cyber-attacks including 
                spying, data breach and information theft in various parts of the world, it is clear that 
                China is working on building a highly capable cyber army. </span>
                Evidently, the internet will be the 
                battleground if and when a war breaks out in the future and thus it is imperative that India is 
                well prepared to defend herself from cyber-intrusion as well as fully capable of mounting a 
                fitting retaliatory offense if the need arises.
