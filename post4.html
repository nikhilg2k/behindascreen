                TVF has applied its original, tried and tested formula once again in its latest web series 
                Aspirants and has successfully delivered yet another brilliantly shot show which will impress 
                viewers with its exquisite balance of charming simplicity and captivating depth.
            </p>
            <p>
                After shows like Kota Factory and Pitchers, Aspirants became another instant hit amongst the 
                Indian youth and shot to the #1 Trending spot on YouTube India within hours of its release. 
                Directed by Apporv Singha Karki and written by Deepesh Sumitra Jagdish, Aspirants tells the story
                 of a UPSC aspirant, Abhilash and chronicles the ups and downs in his preparation, friendships 
                 and relationships.
            </p>
            <p>
                This time we follow the journey of Abhilash as he navigates through the stormy seas of UPSC 
                preparation. The narrative is split into two timelines. We get a glimpse into the past, where 
                the trio is preparing for UPSC together and this is intricately woven with the present where 
                they reunite and struggle to resolve the longstanding conflict between Abhilash and Guri.
            </p>
            <p>
                All characters feel genuine and the actors do a praiseworthy job at bringing their motivations 
                to the screen. Sandeep bhaiya is like a guiding force that everyone wishes for in their lives 
                and SK is that hopeful friend who spares no effort to keep the gang together. Throughout the 
                series we are able to see the growth in all the characters and the show manages to present most 
                scenarios from the perspectives of multiple characters.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thoughtfully written dialogues are the defining strength of the series. They are sure to 
                touch the hearts of all viewers as they are rooted in real life and delivered with impressive 
                tact making it easy to connect and relate to the characters and their emotions. The dialogues 
                are sure to strike a chord in your heart. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Although at times the narrative may feel stretched and the storytelling pace can feel slow, 
                every episode ends at a moment which builds up suspense for the next episode and keeps you 
                engaged with the events unfolding on the screen. 
                The integration of the sponsors is too overt and can be a slight annoyance but that is a small 
                price to pay for high quality content being made available for free on YouTube.
            </p>
            <p>
                Music - The series has an inspiring score that blends in with the screenplay and complements the 
                visuals very well without being overpowering or jarring. The theme is sure to stay in your heart 
                for a long time even after finishing the series.
            </p>
            <p>
                At a time when cinema is saturated with larger-than-life stories, Aspirants' reliance on realism 
                is pleasant and comforting. It is a story of a struggle that every middle-class Indian will 
                relate with even if they did not appear for UPSC and a great opportunity to reminisce for those 
                who braved their way through civil services exams or even other high stake competitive exams. 
                Moreover, it is also a tale about friendships in the real world and the challenges of carefully 
                balancing all aspects of your personal and professional life.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="quote"><span class="bold-text new-line">Rating:</span> The series gets <span class="bold-text italic-text">4 out of 5 stars</span> from me. 
                <span class="new-line"><span class="bold-text">Positives</span> - 1 star for the stunning cinematography, 1 star for the heart touching dialogues, 
                1 star for the realistic plot and relatable characters and 1 star for the soothing music. </span>
                <span class="new-line"><span class="bold-text">Negatives</span> - It loses half a star for a somewhat slow narrative in certain parts and another half 
                for the excessively distracting sponsor integration. </span></span>
                Overall, it is a must watch, especially for all those who are fed up of watching the same old drama 
                in Bollywood and want to watch a new age story inspired from real life.

                I am a student of IIT Delhi. I am an aspiring developer with a knack for writing. 
                This blog is the first project in my journey as a developer which I have built up from scratch. 
                I have created this blog to serve as an outlet for my ideas, thoughts, musings and opinions 
                on everything from everyday student life to national politics. I have previously been published 
                in the online newspaper ThePrint and I wish this blog helps me further my passion for writing.
