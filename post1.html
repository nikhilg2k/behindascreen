                In the past few years the political atmosphere in the country has become conspicuously polarized. 
                Whether it is the comments on a video or tweets on your feed, tempers are always high and anything
                and everything triggers a hostile exchange of insults and abuses. 
                As far as primetime television debates are concerned, the less said, the better. 
                These are the symptoms of a larger illness affecting public discourse, that is, the increasing 
                loyalty of citizens not to the nation but rather to specific political parties. 
                Nowadays whether one supports or opposes any policy is determined by one’s political choices 
                and affiliations, and not by rational analysis. There seems to be an insuppressible urge to 
                discredit any differing opinion by using pejorative labels like ‘bhakt’ or ‘libertard’. 
                This signals a general inability to take an objective stand on any issue of national significance.
            </p>
            <p>
                This notion can be aptly illustrated if we consider the case of the recent farmer's protests in and 
                around the capital. All government supporters will vehemently defend the leaders by maligning the 
                movement through alleged links to ‘khalistanis’ instead of discussing the merits of the laws. 
                On the other hand all non supporters will mindlessly criticise the laws with vague predictions of 
                an imagined ‘slavery to corporations’ and a ‘hate the rich’ mentality demonising industrialists and 
                wealth creators of the nation. Amidst this chaos, the real concerns like benefits of the reforms, 
                contentions to the laws and the larger issue of lack of faith building measures prior to the reforms,
                have drowned in the noises.
            </p>
            <p>
                A similar story emerges if we take a look at India’s fight against COVID-19. One faction firmly 
                believes that the early complete lockdown was a masterstroke that prevented millions of deaths 
                and another faction is convinced that it caused an avoidable socio-economic crisis. 
                The truth, as always, is nuanced, but in a hyperpolarized society there is no place for nuance, 
                no tolerance towards rationality. Any semblance of objectivity comes with a risk of exposing yourself 
                to animosity from both ends of the spectrum.
            </p>

                Before all of us had smartphones in our pockets, our world was largely limited to people in or 
                near our homes, schools and workplaces. The people we met there had different views, opinions and 
                preferences and this made us more mindful and tolerant towards diverse ideas. Today everything on 
                our smartphones is carefully curated to match our own biases and ideologies. Every news article, 
                tweet, instagram post or youtube video that you see was delivered to you by an algorithm actively 
                trying to find out what you want to see to keep you engaged as long as possible. The physical 
                newspapers are the same for everyone with any ideology but your news feed is personalized. This 
                converts any online platform into an echochamber of your own opinions and since finding a community 
                of thousands of people who share the same beliefs has never been easier, you are led to presume that 
                your way is the only right way. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Why, I ask, have we as a people, lost the ability to judge every policy from a non partisan perspective? 
                Why, I ask, have we as a people, become blind to the faults in the leaders we choose? 
                Why, I ask, have we as a people, forgotten that our duty towards our democracy lies in 
                loyalty to the nation, not to any party?
