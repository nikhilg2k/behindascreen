                The Pegasus Spyware Scandal has rekindled the privacy debate. 
                In recent years this debate has centered around Big Tech and user data privacy. 
                Although violation of user privacy by corporations is an important issue that must be 
                investigated and settled, corporate use of consumer data has mostly been limited to 
                innocuous targeted advertisements. We now have a far more sinister matter that has not 
                received the urgent and unadulterated attention that it demands. This is the violation of 
                citizen privacy by the state and the threat it poses to the cherished ideals of our 
                democratic republic. 
            </p>
            <p>
                No nation is oblivious to the destructive potential of cyberspace. 
                This is evident from the fact that many countries classify cyberattacks as the greatest 
                threat to national security. Any technology has the potential to be weaponized. This 
                is exactly what the Israeli NSO has achieved in the form of Pegasus Spyware. 
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="subheading">What is Pegasus Spyware?</span>
                It is perhaps one of the most sophisticated, military grade cyber-weapon that we know of. 
                Once the spyware infiltrates a device it gains access to almost all data on the device including 
                messages, call logs, keystrokes, photos as well as the device microphone, camera and location. 
                There has always been clamor amongst the public about facial recognition software being used 
                in street cameras but a weapon like Pegasus can turn the devices that every person holds in their 
                hands into a dedicated spy cam and location tracker making it the ultimate weapon of 
                surveillance and espionage.
                <span class="new-line">
                    What makes Pegasus even more dangerous is the fact that it has the ability to use non-interactive 
                    modes of infiltration. A link that you didn't click or a message that you didn't open can still 
                    install the spyware on your device without you ever realizing something is awry. 
                    Reports suggest that even a missed WhatsApp call that you may not pay any heed to may be 
                    enough to compromise your device.
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="subheading">The power that this technology holds:</span>
                    It has been argued that such a weapon can be a boon for national and public security 
                    because it can be utilized to surveil terrorist activities or to bust trafficking or 
                    pedophilia rings. When used with conscientious intentions it can thwart heinous terrorist 
                    activities at their roots. 
                <span class="new-line">
                    However, the revelations of The Pegasus Project expose how this weapon can and has 
                    been used by repressive governments to spy on critics and journalists. It is unfortunate 
                    and dismaying to find India on the list of NSO clients amongst countries that are infamous 
                    for undemocratic activities.
                </span>
                <span class="new-line">
                    As it is a developing story, the extent to which Pegasus has been used to target and 
                    surveil journalists so far is not yet clear but it is indubitable from the detailed forensic 
                    reports published by the media consortium that the spyware has indeed been misused for purposes 
                    that are far from fighting terrorism. Even in India the phones of 40 journalists have allegedly 
                    been targeted.
                </span>
                <span class="new-line">
                    It is undeniable that this technology must be utilized as best as possible to fight terrorism 
                    and abuse but being a potential threat to national security, it must be subject to maximum 
                    safeguards against misuse, similar to any other weapon of mass destruction.
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span class="subheading">Should we be concerned?</span>
                It is of grave importance that every citizen be cognizant of the dire repercussions 
                of the exploitation of such technology by the state. It is said that information is 
                power and this weapon can fetch the details of the ins and outs of any person's daily life. 
                It can be used as an impediment to free and fair journalism, as a tool for blackmailing 
                constitutional offices including the judiciary and for dismantling the opposition to the 
                ruling establishment, all the while remaining undetected. 
                <span class="new-line">
                    In the hands of an authoritarian government, this can serve as the last straw 
                    needed for the construction and management of a dystopian surveillance state like 
                    China’s atrocities in Xinjiang.
                </span>
                <span class="quote">
                    Oftentimes it is argued that a lawful citizen must not worry themself with surveillance 
                    for they have nothing to hide. It is assumed that a desire for privacy stems from malintent. 
                    Yet this notion disregards privacy as a fundamental right of every citizen.
                </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                We need to develop a fresh perspective towards our privacy in the digital world. 
                Consider the strict laws regarding search of private property. The state needs warrants to 
                enter and search any property because the owner has the right to privacy in their personal space. 
                Due to the intangible nature of cyberspace and the lack of unambiguous laws pertaining to it, 
                this is often overlooked. 
                <span class="new-line">
                    The question then arises, should the state not require a warrant to surveil its citizen's 
                    private data? Abiding by the law must not be correlated with consenting to constant or 
                    incontestable monitoring of anyone’s private life. Our lives are irreversibly entangled 
                    with the digital world. There is an urgent need to formulate unequivocal regulations and 
                    laws that enlist the rights and govern the activities of the citizens as well as the state 
                    in the virtual world.
